Hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA)
Regression analysis (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression)
Other relevant statistical methods.

List the software and tools used for analysis (e.g., Python with libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn; R; statistical software like SPSS or Stata)
